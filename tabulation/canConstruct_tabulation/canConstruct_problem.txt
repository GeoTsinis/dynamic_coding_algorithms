Write a function canConstruct(target, wordBank) that accepts a 
target string and an array of strings.

The function should return a boolean indicating wheter or not the target
can be constructed by concatenating elements of the wordBank array.

You may reuse elements of wordBank as many times as you want.

Example: canConstruct(abcdef, [ab, abc, cd, def, abcd]) -> true
         canConstruct(skateboard, [bo, rd, ate, t, ska, boar]) -> false
