You are a traveler on 2D grid. You begin in the top-left corner
of the grid and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner.
You may only move down and right.

In how many ways can you travel to the goal on a grid
with dimensions m * n ?

Write a function gridTraveler(m,n) that calculates this.
