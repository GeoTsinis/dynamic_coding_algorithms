Write a function canSum(targetSum, numbers) that takes in
a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return a boolean indication whether or not it is possible
to generate the targetSum using numbers from the array.

You may use an element from the array as many times as you want.

You may assume that all numbers in the array are not negative numbers.
